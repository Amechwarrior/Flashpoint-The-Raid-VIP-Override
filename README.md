# Flashpoint-The-Raid-VIP-Override

This is a optional add-on for "Flashpoint: The Raid" when used with the Vehicle Improvement Project to prevent fatal loading errors.
### Description:

The LRM/SRM carriers have had "Turret" locations added and gear moved to match the Vehicle Improvement Projects' formatting.  Without this, players will not be able to load mission IV or V when using both "The Raid" and VIP.
### Instructions:
    Install Flashpoint: The Raid and VIP,
    Copy "Flashpoint-The-Raid-VIP-Override" folder in to Mods folder created for ModTek.
    
### Required Mods:
This mod needs ModTek, Flashpoint: The Raid and VIP to work:
